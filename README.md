📚 Flask Book API: A RESTful CRUD Service

A beginner-friendly REST API built with Python and the Flask micro-framework. 
This project demonstrates core backend skills by providing a complete service 
to manage a collection of books, including CRUD operations, dynamic query filtering, 
and file-based data persistence.

Two versions are included:
- basic_flask_book_api.py — In-memory storage for learning and quick demos.
- app.py — Persistent version with pagination, rate limiting, logging, and improved error handling.

## ✨ Features

Full CRUD Implementation: Supports all standard REST operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- **GET /api/books**: Retrieve all books or filter by 
                      `title`, `author`, `id`, `year`, or `isbn`.
    - **Pagination** supported with ?page=<number>&limit=<number> query parameters.
- **POST /api/books**: Add new books. Duplicate books (same title & author) are ignored.
- **PUT /api/books/<book_id>**: Update a book's information.
- **DELETE /api/books/<book_id>**: Delete a book by ID.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of API endpoints.
    - GET /api/books → 10 requests per minute
    - PUT /api/books/<book_id> → 5 requests per minute
    - DELETE /api/books/<book_id> → 3 requests per minute
- **Error Handling**: Returns clear HTTP status codes and JSON error messages 
                      for invalid requests:
    - 400 Bad Request → invalid input or duplicate book
    - 404 Not Found → book or page not found
    - 429 Too Many Requests → rate limit exceeded
- **Persistence**: Books are stored in `data/books.json`.
- **Validation**: Invalid query parameters and invalid book IDs return proper error messages.
- **Application Logging**: Uses Python's standard logging library to track request flow, state changes, 
                           and errors at the INFO level.

## ⚙️ Installation

Prerequisites
    - Python 3.x

Steps
1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>


2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 Usage

Run the Flask API: python app.py

The API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5055/api/books

## API Endpoints and Examples

| Method   | Endpoint            | Description                   | Example Request/Body                                                                       |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET      | /api/books          | Retrieve all books            | `GET http://127.0.0.1:5055/api/books`                                                      |
| GET      | /api/books?filter   | Filter books by any valid key | `GET http://127.0.0.1:5055/api/books?author=George Orwell`                                 |
| POST     | /api/books          | Add one or more new books     | ```json {"title": "New Book", "author": "John Doe", "year": 2025} ```                      |
| PUT      | /api/books/<int:id> | Update an existing book by ID | ```json PUT http://127.0.0.1:5055/api/books/1 {"title": "Updated Title", "year": 2023} ``` |
| DELETE   | /api/books/<int:id> | Delete a book by ID           | `DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5055/api/books/1`                                                 |


 
 ## 🖥 Client Script: Fetch All Books

The `client_fetch_books.py` script acts as a client to fetch books from the API
in pages of 10 until all books are retrieved. It prints progress and totals
to the console.

## 🚀 Usage

Make sure the Flask API is running: 

```
python app.py
```

Then run the client script: 

```
python client_fetch_books.py
```

### Example Output

```
Fetched 10 books on page 1
Fetched 10 books on page 2
...
No more books after page 11
Finished fetching 103 books
```

## 🪵 Logging Configuration:
The API uses Python's built-in logging module to provide visibility into request handling and internal processes.

By default, the logger is configured to:

    - Level: Processes messages at INFO severity and higher, utilizing DEBUG for 
             internal diagnostics (like JSON parsing attempts).
    - Efficiency: Logging is implemented with efficient placeholder formatting (%s, %d) 
             to minimize processing overhead.
    - Output: Write logs to the console (sys.stderr).
    - Format: Include the timestamp, log level, and the message content.

## Example Log Output:
```
2025-11-04 21:07:17, INFO: GET request received for /api/books
2025-11-04 21:07:17, INFO: Returning 10 books for page 1
```

💾 Customization: Logging to a File

For persistent storage (recommended for production), you can easily redirect logs to a file by updating the 
logging.basicConfig() call in app.py and adding the filename parameter:

# Change console logging to file logging
```
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO, 
    filename='api.log', # ⬅️ ADD THIS PARAMETER
    # ... include other format and datefmt parameters here
)
```
